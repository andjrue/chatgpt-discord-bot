### TO-DO's

- [ ] Set up OpenAI API stuff
- [ ] Create .mp3's using the OpenAI API <br>
  -> I've gotten it to a point where it will upload a file with the user name.<br>
     We probably want this to say "{Username} has joined the channel" or something along those lines.
- [ ] I need to figure out how to use ffempeg to get this to work. Through all of my googling, it looks pretty difficult but it's been done before. <br>
      I assumed that sending audio would be easy, but I was seriously mistaken.
- [ ] Actually configure AWS credentials <br>
